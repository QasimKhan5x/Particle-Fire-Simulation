# Particle Fire Simulation
This program manages a bunch of virtual particles that gradually change color and circle around each other. The particles have a nice blur effect to them as well.

# Further Explorations
- [ ] Create an installer
- [ ] Use swarms of particles to find approximate solutions to equations **(AI)**
- [ ] Create fountains **(GUI)**
- [ ] Allow particles to bounce around the screen and orbit each other **(GUI)**
- [ ] Create mathematical simulations of how particles move **(Math)**
